This project shows a map of Bern, Switzerland with a list of interesting locations.

Getting Started
===============

The project uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/). These dependencies are not included
in this repository and have to be installed using [Bower](http://bower.io). If you don't have Bower, you'll need to 
install it first using `npm install -g bower`

Once you have Bower on your computer, simply call `npm install` in the project's
root directory to install jQuery and Knockout.

After all dependencies have been installed, simply open the file `index.html` in your browser.
