<h2>Project Overview</h2>

You will develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

<h2>Why this Project?</h2>

The neighborhood tour application is complex enough and incorporates a variety of data points that it can easily become unwieldy to manage. There are a number of frameworks, libraries and APIs available to make this process more manageable and many employers are looking for specific skills in using these packages.

<h2>What will I Learn?</h2>

You will learn how design patterns assist in developing a manageable codebase. You’ll then explore how frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a number of utilities for you to use. Finally, you’ll implement third-party APIs that provide valuable data sets that can improve the quality of your application.

<h2>How will I complete this Project?</h2>

<ol>
<li>Review our course JavaScript Design Patterns.
<li>Download the Knockout framework.
<li>Write code required to add a full-screen map to your page using the Google Maps API.
<li>Write code required to add map markers identifying a number of locations your are interested in within this neighborhood.
<li>Implement the search bar functionality to search and filter your map markers. There should be a filtering function on markers that already show up. Simply providing a search function through a third-party API is not enough.
<li>Implement a list view of the identified locations.
<li>Add additional functionality using third-party APIs when a map marker, search result, or list view entry is clicked (ex. Yelp reviews, Wikipedia, Flickr images, etc). If you need a refresher on making AJAX requests to third-party servers, check out our Intro to AJAX course.
